          <h2>Navigation:</h2>
          <p>We have structured our website to ensure that it is easy to navigate. We have also included skip links that allow users to bypass repetitive content and jump directly to the main content of each page.</p>
          <h2>Alternative Text for Images:</h2>
          <p>All images on our website have alternative text descriptions. Alternative text is a description of the image that can be read by assistive technology, such as screen readers. By providing alternative text, users who cannot see the images can still understand the content they represent.</p>
          <h2>Color Contrast:</h2>
          <p>We have designed our website to ensure that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground text and background colors. This ensures that users with visual impairments can read our site with ease. We use color combinations that meet WCAG's minimum contrast ratio requirements to ensure that all users can access our content.</p>
          <h2>Font Size:</h2>
          <p>We have made it possible for users to adjust the font size on our website. This feature is especially beneficial to users with visual impairments or users who prefer larger text. Users can increase or decrease the font size using their browser's settings or the zoom feature.</p>
          <h2>Accessible Forms:</h2>
          <p>We have designed our forms to be fully accessible to users who are visually impaired or have other disabilities. This includes using label tags to associate form fields with their labels, making it easier for screen reader users to fill out forms. We have also added instructions and error messages to help users complete forms correctly.</p>
          <h2>PDF Accessibility:</h2>
          <p>We are committed to ensuring that our PDF documents are fully accessible to all users. All PDFs on our website are optimized for accessibility and can be read using screen readers. We have added alternative text descriptions to all images within PDFs and have made sure that all text is selectable, copyable, and searchable.</p>
          <h2>Audio and Video Accessibility:</h2>
          <p>We are committed to providing accessible audio and video content to all users. We have added closed captions to all videos on our website and have provided transcripts for all audio content. This ensures that users who are deaf or hard of hearing can understand the content, and that users who cannot access the audio or video content can still read the transcript.</p>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>We are continuously working to improve the accessibility of our website. If you have any questions or concerns about the accessibility of our website, please contact us. We welcome your feedback and suggestions as we continue to improve the accessibility of our site.</p>
